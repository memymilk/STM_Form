Questions:
1. In case the user selects "other" - should the original field record nothing, or should it record "other"? Asking for statistics reasons
Right now the single select records "other" and th multitag select records nothing, which way to unify it?
2. There is a typo in var var footprint_calculations_specify in the example
3. Q37 - the field has an option for custom input which says it is mandatory, but there is no variable for it in the list, I made it: policy_coproduction_specify
4. Q38 - do we need a custom field for other? There is no variable name for it so I assumed we do not, but want to double check.
5. I am not sure between the names sdg_assessment, selected_adgs and sdg_assessmet_method? I put sdg_assessment for Q43 and sdg_assessmet_method for Q44, not sure what does selected_adgs belong to.
